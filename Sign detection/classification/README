For traffic sign classfication:
1. dataset: German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) Including: training set: 39209 images;testing set:12630 images;
   classes: 43; image size: 32x32
2. model: LENET-5
3. training: For the loss we used CrossEntropy + softmax for multi-category classfication; Optimzer we used Adaptive Moment Estimation(Adam) here;
   metrics we used here is accuracy that 'predicted correct sample size/ total sample'; within 50 epochs the accuracy is 99.4% .
4. test: we used trained model file to inference the accuracy of the whole testing set images. accuracy is 90.4%
